Website scraping
When scraping and analying the weather data from the mars website, I was able to discover the following:
There are 12 total months on mars, similar to Earth except the length of time is different.
The data contains around 687 sols, which estimates to about one year on Mars.
The coldest month in Mars, according to the data, is month 3. The warmest month is month 8.
The month with the lowest atmospheric pressure on Mars is month 6. The month with the highest pressure is month 9.
Lastly, when comparing Martian years to Earth years, one Martian year is estimated to be around 687 days on Earth. Therefore, almost 2 years on Earth is the same as one year on Mars!
